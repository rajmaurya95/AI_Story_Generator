         <p className='p-2'> It was the year 2050 and all writing had become automated with the help of AI technology. Aspiring writers now had access to a new tool called the "AI Story_Generator". It was a revolutionary program that would analyze the writer's thoughts and ideas, and generate a fully developed story in a matter of seconds. Sally was a struggling writer who had lost her creative spark, and turning to the AI Story_Generator was her last hope. As she hit the "generate" button, she was amazed by the complex and imaginative story that appeared on her screen. With this powerful tool, Sally's passion for writing was reignited and she went on to become a best-selling author.
